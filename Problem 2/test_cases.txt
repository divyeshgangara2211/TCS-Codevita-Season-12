Sai's Mini Project Problem Description 

Sai is working on a mini project where he needs to handle various tasks related to a bank account. 
This includes 6 operations viz., read, credit, debit, abort, rollback and commit. 

The operation semantics are explained below.

read - read and print the balance in the account 

credit - money credited to the account 

debit - money debited from the account 

abort X - the Xth transaction from the beginning is aborted (cancelled). 
Note that you can't abort the transactions once they are committed. Only credit and debit operations are counted as transactions 
For understanding abort, lets understand the example below - credit 1000 commit abort 1 This abort cannot be done since the transaction has already been committed. 

rollback X - rollback the Xth commit. 
In this case, the account balance will be automatically updated to what it was, right after the Xth commit. 

commit - the changes are saved permanently and cannot be undone using an abort command. 

The credit, debit, abort and rollback operations will always be followed by a positive integer, whereas read and commit operations have no such operand. 
Given the initial balance and a sequence of operations performed in order, determine the resulting output.

Constraints :
1 <= initial amount <= 1000 
1 <= Number of operations (N) <= 50 
Current account balance will always be 0 or a positive value. It can never be negative. 
The integer following "abort" and "rollback" will be at least 1 and will not exceed the total number of transactions and commits up to that point, respectively.

Input :
The first line contains an integer denoting the initial balance of the account. 
Second line consists of an integer N denoting the number of operations performed. 
The subsequent N lines will contain operations following the above syntaxes. 

Output :
Output the account balance each time a read statement is encountered. 

Time Limit 
(secs) 1 

Examples : 

Example 1 :
Input :
90 
8 
read 
credit 10 
debit 12 
debit 8 
credit 7 
abort 1 
commit 
read 

Output :
90 
77 

Explanation :- 
Initial balance: 90 
Operation 1 - Read, prints the account balance i.e., 90 
Operation 2 - Credit 10, Result: Balance increases by 10. New balance: 100 
Operation 3 - Debit 12, Result: Balance decreases by 12. New balance: 88 
Operation 4 - Debit 8, Result: Balance decreases by 8. New balance: 80 
Operation 5 - Credit 7, Result: Balance increases by 7. New balance: 87 
Operation 6 - Abort 1, this means undoing the changes made by the 1st transaction (the credit of 10). So, the account balance will become 77 .
Operation 7 - Commit, this commits all previous changes made. Account balance will be updated as 77 
Operation 8 - Read, prints the account balance i.e., 77 


Example 2 :

Input :
43 
10 
credit 12
debit 10
commit
abort 1
read
credit 30 
debit 4 
rollback 1
commit 
read

Output :
45
45 

Explanation :- 
Initial balance: 43 
Operation 1 - Credit 12, Result: Balance increases by 12. New balance: 55 
Operation 2 - Debit 10, Result: Balance decreases by 10. New balance: 45 
Operation 3 - Commit, this commits all changes made so far. Account balance will become 45. 
Operation 4 - Abort 1, this means undoing the changes made by the 1st transaction. Since the changes of 1st transaction has already been committed it's impossible to abort it. Hence, the account balance remains same. 
Operation 5 - Read, prints the account balance i.e., 45 
Operation 6 - Credit 30, Result: Balance increases by 30. New balance: 75 
Operation 7 - Debit 4, Result: Balance decreases by 4. New balance: 71 
Operation 8 - Rollback 1, this means the account balance will be rolled back to what it was, after commit 1 i.e., 45. Refer Operation 3 which is the 1st commit. 
Operation 9 - Commit, this commits all changes made since the last commit. Account balance will be updated as 45 
Operation 10 - Read, prints the account balance i.e., 45
