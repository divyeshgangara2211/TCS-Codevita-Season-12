Problem Description
Reenu is an electrical engineer who frequently designs new circuits. She constructs circuits using two types of resistors: horizontal and vertical, along with a junction. In each circuit, there are two positions: an opening and a closing. The circuit is connected to the power supply at the opening position, and the current flows through the resistors and junctions until it reaches the closing position.

In the matrix representation of the circuit, power can only flow vertically (up or down) if a vertical resistor is present, and it can only flow horizontally (left or right) if a horizontal resistor is present. The junction connects all four sides. The vertical and horizontal resistors have 1 units of resistance, while the junction considered to be having low resistance, ignorable.

Vertical resistor is represented by "|" (pipe), horizontal represented by "-"(hyphen) .a "." (period) symbol represents terminals and "+" (plus) representing junction.


The resistance for series connection is RT = R1 + R2 and for parallel connection is 1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2.To know about resistance in series and parallel look here.

Given the circuit, reduce and determine the equal resistance of the circuit between opening position and closing position.
