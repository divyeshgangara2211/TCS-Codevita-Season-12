Two friends went to the mall for shopping. While there, they decided to buy friendship bands. 
The shop sells bands in pairs inside a case, which is exactly what they wanted. These bands could be of different shapes and sizes. 
These band pairs were displayed in a transparent box inside the shop. 
While most of them were fine i.e., two distinct and separate bands, in some cases the pairs of bands encased in the transparent box were not separate but were interlocked instead.
Now, the bands should not be interlocked because then it would mean cutting one of them to separate the two. 
However, that was the case and there were complaints regarding the same. 
They did not want to miss out celebrating Friendship Day and desperately wanted the bands. Since the bands were packed in transparent cases, they could see the bands inside. 
They decided to select a good pair of bands from the case. They took photos of the cases and fed it to an AI program that could mathematically detect if there was interlocking between bands or not. 
The band case is represented in a square matrix format of size S. The bands are depicted by the characters "1" and "2," where they represent the first and second band, respectively. 
The period symbol "." indicates an empty space. The bands will only bend at right angles. One band will intersect the other exactly at a right angle, but they will never overlap at the corners. 
The character at the point of overlap indicates which band is on top, while the other character's band is underneath. 
To avoid confusion for them, the bands will not be kept adjacent and will have some space between them i.e. if a thread is running horizontal, then another thread will not run horizontal on the adjacent cells. vice versa for vertical also.
